## Why I develop this

I'm not an English native speaker, but English is truly important for me. I learn something in my native language(Chinese) and remember its English name so that I know it when I read English paper. 

Usually I create a note about a concept in Chinese and attach its English name after Chinese name. But I don't think that's very aesthetically pleasing, so I developed this plugin.
